Notes

$health_card_number = filter_input(INPUT_POST, 'health_card_number', FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING);

***Retrieves the health_card_number from a POST request. The filter_input() function is a built-in PHP function that gets a specific external variable by name and optionally filters it.
'health_card_number' is the variable we want from the POST data. FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING is a filter that removes tags and remove or encode special characters from a string to prevent sql attacks.


if (!preg_match("/^\d{4}-\d{3}-\d{3} [A-Z]{2}$/", $health_card_number)) { 

***Checks if the health_card_number matches a specific pattern. The preg_match() function is a PHP function that performs a regular expression match. The expression "/^\d{4}-\d{3}-\d{3} [A-Z]{2}$/" checks for a string that exactly matches the pattern of four digits, followed by a hyphen, three digits, another hyphen, three more digits, a space, and finally two uppercase letters.



$errors[] = "Health Care Number format invalid."; 

***If the health_card_number does not match the pattern, a new error message “Health Care Number format invalid.” is ADDED to the $errors array for later output.
