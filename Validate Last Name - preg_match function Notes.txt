// Sanitize and Validate last name
// PHP function to check $last_name does not match pattern > 2 letters
// Error - place in array
$last_name = filter_input(INPUT_POST, 'last_name', FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING);

}

Notes

$last_name = filter_input(INPUT_POST, 'last_name', FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING);

***Retrieves the last_name from a POST request. The filter_input() function is a built-in PHP function that gets a specific external variable by name and optionally filters it.
'last_name' is the variable we want from the POST data. FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING is a filter that removes tags and remove or encode special characters from a string to prevent sql attacks.


if (!preg_match("/^[a-zA-Z]{2,20}$/", $last_name)) {

***Checks if the last_name matches a specific pattern. The preg_match() function is a PHP function that performs a regular expression match. The expression "/^[a-zA-Z]{2,20}$/" checks for a string that exactly matches the pattern of uppercase OR lowercase letters, be 2-20 characters in length, no numbers, spaces, or special characters.



$errors[] = "Last name must be between 2-20 characters in length.";

***If the health_card_number does not match the pattern, a new error message “Last name must be between 2-20 characters in length.” is ADDED to the $errors array for later output.
