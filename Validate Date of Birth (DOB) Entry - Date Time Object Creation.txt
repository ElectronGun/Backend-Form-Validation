Validate Date of Birth (DOB)

// Sanitize and Validate date of birth
// DOB must not be in future, otherwise error
// Error - place in array
$dob = new DateTime(filter_input(INPUT_POST, 'dob', FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING));
$now = new DateTime();
if ($dob > $now) {
    $errors[] = "The date year must be before the current year 2024.";
}

Notes

$dob = new DateTime(filter_input(INPUT_POST, 'dob', FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING));

***Retrieves the dob from a POST request. The filter_input() function is a built-in PHP function that gets a specific external variable by name and optionally filters it.
'dob' is the variable we want from the POST data. FILTER_SANITIZE_STRING is a filter that removes tags and remove or encode special characters from a string to prevent sql attacks.

$now = new DateTime();

***Creates a new DateTime object with the current date and time and assigns it to the variable $now.

if ($dob > $now) {

***Checks if the date of birth is later than the current date. If it is, an error is sent to array.

$errors[] = "The date year must be before the current year 2024.";

***If the dob is later than $now, a new error message “The date year must be before the current year 2024.” is ADDED to the $errors array for later output.
